# react-wrapper
Allows the dev server to be used in a NUI (with messages as well)

## How to use

### CRA
Load `utility_react.js` using the cdn (https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/XenoS-ITA/react-wrapper/utility_react.js) in a html file and start the react development server using the `npm start` command, like you always do when you use react.  
The connection is done automatically using the `localhost:3000` address.

### Vite
Load `utility_vite.js` using the cdn (https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/XenoS-ITA/react-wrapper/utility_vite.js) in a html file and start the vite development server using the `vite` command, like you always do when you use vite.  
The connection is done automatically using the `127.0.0.1:5173` address.

**TIP**: Create a second file called devindex or something similar so you can switch between the two quickly from the manifest
